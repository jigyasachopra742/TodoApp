# Todo App with Local Storage Readme

This is a simple Todo app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows us to create, manage, and track our tasks locally in your web browser using local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: We can easily add new tasks to our to-do list app.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete when we finish them.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your list when they are no longer needed.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update or Edit the tasks in out list.
- **Local Storage**: Our tasks are stored locally in our browser's local storage, so they will persist even if we close our browser or refresh the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

To use the Todo app with local storage, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

3. We will see the Todo app interface, consisting of an input field to add new tasks, a list of tasks, and options to mark tasks as complete or delete them or edit them.

## Usage

- **Add a Task**: Enter the task we want to add in the input field and press Enter or click the "Add" button.

- **Complete a Task**: To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task. Completed tasks will have a strike-through effect.

- **Delete a Task**: To delete a task, click the delete button next to the task.

- **Local Storage**: Our tasks will be automatically saved to our browser's local storage. They will persist even if we close the browser or refresh the page.
